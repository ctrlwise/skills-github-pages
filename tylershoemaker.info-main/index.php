        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Tyler Shoemaker is an assistant professor of critical AI in the
        <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/english/index.html",
        target="_blank">Department of English</a> at Texas A&amp;M University.
        He conducts research on language technology, focusing on how methods in
        natural language processing crosscut the interpretive and theoretic
        frameworks of literary and media studies. Particular areas of interests
        include large language models, hermeneutics and interpretability, media
        archaeology, and semiotics. Before joining the faculty at Texas A&amp;M,
        Tyler was a fellow at the <a href="https://neukom.dartmouth.edu"
        target="_blank">Neukom Institute for Computational Science</a> and a
        postdoctoral scholar affiliated with the <a
        href="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">UC Davis
        DataLab</a>.</p> <p><a href="docs/shoemaker_cv.pdf">Full CV
